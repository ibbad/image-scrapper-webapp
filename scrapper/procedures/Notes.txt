Development Notes
Design Choices
1. We can use regex for finding <img> tags in the web page content. However,
my regex (and available on Internet) for finding the "src" attribute in <img>
tag miss some cases. BeautifulSoup performed better than regex and gives a
cleaner look to the code that is why I am using it.


Limitations:
1. The beautiful soup code will only look for <img> tags with both "alt" and
"src" attributes available.

Implementation details.
1. In order to save absolute path for respective relative paths (of images) in
the file, I first used the technique to construct absolute path for the file
(while manually removing parent director and appending subdirectory of image).
However, that was a hack and may end up becoming a bug later during the
lifecycle of script. Hence, I removed it.
